Paper Overview
This paper addresses the problem of efficiently determining whether two triangles in three-dimensional space intersect, which is a fundamental operation in collision detection systems. The authors propose a fast triangle-to-triangle intersection algorithm that significantly reduces the number of arithmetic operations compared to previous methods. Their approach is algebraic, focusing on solving sets of related linear equations more efficiently by reusing common elements, and it can also compute the exact intersection points with minimal additional cost.

Problem Statement
In many fields such as computer animation, virtual reality, robotics, and molecular modeling, collision detection is crucial for determining if two objects intersect. Since objects are typically represented as meshes made of triangles, this reduces to the problem of determining if any triangles from one mesh intersect with triangles from another mesh.

Existing methods, while efficient, still require numerous triangle-to-triangle intersection tests at the lowest levels of hierarchical data structures. Therefore, the need arises for a faster and more computationally efficient algorithm for these intersection tests, especially for scenarios where intersections are likely.

Proposed Algorithm
The authors introduce a five-stage algorithm that improves efficiency by reusing calculations and avoiding expensive operations like division wherever possible. The algorithm works as follows:

Stage 1: Compute intersection parameters (
ùõΩ
ùëñ
Œ≤ 
i
‚Äã
 ) for the edges of the first triangle with the plane of the second triangle using determinants. This step can quickly determine if there is no intersection.

Stage 2: If no valid parameters (
ùõΩ
ùëñ
Œ≤ 
i
‚Äã
 ) are found, reject the possibility of intersection early.

Stage 3: Construct the intersection line segment between the first triangle and the plane of the second triangle if potential intersections exist.

Stage 4: Check if this line segment intersects with any edges of the second triangle or lies fully within the second triangle.

Stage 5 (Optional): If needed, compute the exact intersection points by combining the previously calculated parameters and vectors.

Optimization Techniques:

Reuse of Calculations: Exploiting the linearity of matrix operations to reduce repeated calculations.
Avoiding Divisions: Replace divisions with determinant-based checks to reduce computational cost.
Key Contributions
Efficiency Improvement:

The algorithm performs 95‚Äì97 arithmetic operations, compared to 114‚Äì144 operations in the best previous methods.
It avoids divisions, which are typically 4‚Äì8 times more expensive than other arithmetic operations.
Performance Gains:

Experimental results show that the algorithm runs 18.9% faster on a Pentium 4 processor and 12.6% faster on a Celeron processor compared to the fastest previous algorithm.
Exact Intersection Points:

The algorithm can compute the exact coordinates of intersection points with minimal additional cost.
Generality:

The principles of the algorithm can be applied to other geometric intersection problems, such as rectangle-to-rectangle intersection tests.
Practical Robustness:

While the algorithm has slightly higher error rates in degenerate cases (e.g., coplanar edges), the difference is minor and acceptable for typical collision detection scenarios.
Conclusion
The paper presents a novel, algebraic approach to triangle-to-triangle intersection tests, providing both theoretical and practical improvements over existing methods. Its efficiency makes it particularly useful for real-time collision detection systems where rapid intersection checks are critical.
